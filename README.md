# app
Welcome to the Blank Humanity React App! This app houses tools and toys to delight the Blank Humanity community and welcomes community development. Check our discord for posted bounties (at least until the bounty to reactify the bounty system is fulfilled) to see how you can earn some ETH building new functionality in this repository.

## Structure

This app uses nextjs for routing, so you'll find the starting point for each feature in /src/pages. 
You'll find some shared components in /src/components/common, and some custom modules in /src/components/modules.
You'll find usable data related to the Initializer NFT collection in /src/utils/initializers-metadata-lookup.json, which is indexed by Initializer # and contains the src url for the image.
